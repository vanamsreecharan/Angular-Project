EasyTask: Enterprise-Level Task Management
Overview
EasyTask is an enterprise task management system designed to streamline team collaboration, task delegation, and project tracking for companies. It provides a centralized platform for managing multiple team members and their respective tasks, ensuring that project deadlines and deliverables are tracked efficiently.

Key Features
User Management

The left-hand side panel shows a list of team members, allowing easy selection of users for task management.
Each team member can have individual tasks assigned to them.
Examples of users in this demo are Marcus Johnson, Jasmine Washington, Emily Thompson, etc.
Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned to each user with a due date, description, and a status tracker.
Tasks are displayed clearly for the selected user on the right-hand side.
Users can mark tasks as completed using the "Complete" button next to each task.
Task Details

Each task includes:
Title: A brief summary of the task.
Due Date: The deadline for task completion.
Description: Detailed instructions or information about the task.
For example:
Task 1: "Build first prototype" (due May 31, 2024).
Task 2: "Prepare issue template" (due June 15, 2024).
Add Task Functionality

The system allows managers to add new tasks to a user by clicking the “Add Task” button.
This ensures that tasks are continually updated, providing flexibility for project changes or updates.
How It Works
Team Leaders or Project Managers can assign tasks by selecting a user from the list and adding tasks with detailed instructions.
The interface ensures visibility for both task owners (employees) and managers, allowing them to keep track of deadlines, priorities, and progress.
Tasks can easily be updated and completed, giving everyone a clear picture of what has been accomplished and what still needs attention.
